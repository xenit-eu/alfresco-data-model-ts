## ClassDefinition.parent property

Parent class from which this class inherits.

Similar to inheritance in code, a node that has this class applied also has the parent classes applied.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly parent: QNameWithTypeTag<QNameTypeTag.CLASS> | null;
```

## Remarks

Note that parents must be the same kind of class (type or aspect) as this class.

For types, a parent is normally always specified, except for `sys:base`<!-- -->, which is the base class of the type hierarchy. For aspects, a parent is usually not specified, but it is possible to specify an other aspect as parent.
